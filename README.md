# gafr-apocalypse

This is a game made during a game design class in COMSC-341GP. It's not quite in a ship-ready state (it's rather unstable at the testing hub, for example), but
it's enough for demonstration purposes. The player moves throughout the levels by opening doors, flipping levers, acquiring keycards, and controlling
a robot which is unlocked early in the game. 

All code and art was created by me--music assets were sourced from Pixabay.com. 

The game library used was a custom framework created by my professor, GaFr (https://github.com/profmccauley/gafr). 
It's not included in this repository but is required for the game to run. The documentation of that project gives
instructions for installing the framework. 

Starting the project will put you at the testing hub, which is rather crash-prone, due to some of the test levels 
assuming that the robot is either locked or unlocked. Enter the upper-leftmost door to play through the existing levels.
